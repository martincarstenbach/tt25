# Thementage25 Demo

This blog post complements my recent presentation at [Thementage 2025 Remote](https://www.ittage.informatik-aktuell.de/konferenz/it-tage-365-remote-2025.html). I demo'd how to use CI/CD with relational databases, based on Oracle's SQL Developer Command Line (SQLcl).

Please refer to the blog posts for more details:
