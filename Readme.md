# Thementage25 Demo

This blog post complements my recent presentation at [Thementage 2025 Remote](https://www.ittage.informatik-aktuell.de/konferenz/it-tage-365-remote-2025.html). As part of my talk I showed a live demo how to use Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (aka CI/CD) in the context of relational databases. For this demo I used Oracle's [SQL Developer Command Line (SQLcl)](https://www.oracle.com/sqlcl) and [APEX](https://apex.oracle.com/en/), a very popular low-code development environment.
